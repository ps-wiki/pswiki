## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.
